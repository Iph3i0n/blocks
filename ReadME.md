# Starter Dough

This is a web component framework designed to fullfill all styling needs. It also has basic behaviour for displaying things like modals. It is designed to work with any front-end framework or library, such as React, Vue, or Angular. It should also work with any other rendering engines, like HandleBars or Razor.

To use it simply import it as a script tag.

```HTML
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/starter-dough/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

The package is also on NPM with all of the source available for anyone that wants to do a custom integration. This is not an optimised process and it is recommended to look at the webpack config and package files from the repro to better understand how to integrated it.

A larger documentation section is incoming as a separate website that uses this framework.
